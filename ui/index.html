           <h2>What do you need to do to succeed in IMAD?</h2>
           <p>
            We hope that all of you are busy watching the IMAD lectures. Content for the first three weeks has been released so far and the assignments for all three weeks are open. Week 2 content is very heavy on practicals. These practical modules will solidify your theoretical understanding and help you see what the internals of a web-app actually are and how they are built! The content covers a lot of concepts, and for non-programmers or non-software engineers things might get difficult.
